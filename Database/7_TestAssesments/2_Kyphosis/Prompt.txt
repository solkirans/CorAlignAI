Posture Problems:
-Kyphosis
This is an excessive outward curvature of the thoracic spine (mid-back), often resulting in a hunched or rounded back appearance.
-Lordosis
Characterized by an exaggerated inward curve of the lumbar spine (lower back), commonly referred to as swayback.
-Scoliosis
A condition where the spine curves sideways in an "S" or "C" shape, affecting its overall alignment.
-Flat Back Syndrome
Occurs when the spine loses its natural curves, becoming abnormally straight, particularly in the lumbar or thoracic regions.
-Forward Head Posture
The head juts forward beyond its neutral position, placing strain on the cervical spine (neck).
-Rounded Shoulders
The shoulders roll forward, often linked to an increased curve in the thoracic spine.
-Text Neck
Similar to forward head posture, this is caused by prolonged looking down at devices, stressing the cervical spine.
-Pelvic Tilt
This can be anterior (tilting forward) or posterior (tilting backward), altering the lumbar spine's alignment.
-Hyperlordosis
An extreme form of lordosis with an excessively pronounced inward lumbar curve.
-Slumped Sitting Posture
A common issue where the entire spine slouches forward during sitting, affecting the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar regions.

r_medial_pressure,9,"Right inner foot pressure?","Shows if your right foot’s inner edge has less or more weight (-10 = very light, +10 = very heavy, 0 = normal).","Stand and feel how much pressure is on the inner right foot. If barely any, go negative. If a lot, go positive. Zero is normal."
l_single_leg,10,"Left single-leg balance?","Checks if standing on your left leg feels unstable or steady (-10 = very secure, +10 = very wobbly, 0 = normal).","Try balancing on the left leg. If it’s super shaky, go positive. If rock-solid, go negative. Zero is an average balance."

l_weight_shift,10,"Left side weight shift?","Shows if shifting weight to your left side feels controlled or not (-10 = controlled, +10 = uncontrolled, 0 = normal).","Gently lean or shift weight to the left. If you feel stable, go negative. If it’s hard to control, go positive. Zero is typical control."
r_weight_shift,10,"Right side weight shift?","Shows if shifting weight to your right side feels controlled or not (-10 = controlled, +10 = uncontrolled, 0 = normal).","Gently lean or shift weight to the right. If you feel stable, go negative. If it’s hard to control, go positive. Zero is typical control."
l_arm_raising,10,"Left arm raising pattern?","Checks if lifting your left arm is smooth or awkward (-10 = very smooth, +10 = very compensated, 0 = normal).","Raise your left arm overhead. If it’s jerky or you have to compensate a lot, go positive. If it’s easy and fluid, go negative. Zero is normal movement."
r_arm_raising,10,"Right arm raising pattern?","Checks if lifting your right arm is smooth or awkward (-10 = very smooth, +10 = very compensated, 0 = normal).","Raise your right arm overhead. If it’s jerky or you have to compensate a lot, go positive. If it’s easy and fluid, go negative. Zero is normal movement."
squat_symmetry,10,"Squat pattern left/right?","Shows if squatting leans left or right (-10 = heavily left, +10 = heavily right, 0 = balanced).","Do a slow squat. If you shift more to the left, go negative. If you shift more to the right, go positive. Zero means you stay centered."
gait_symmetry,10,"Walking pattern left/right?","Checks if your walk favors one side (-10 = left side, +10 = right side, 0 = balanced).","Walk normally. If you lean or push off more on the left, go negative. If more on the right, go positive. Zero is even."
l_upper_pain,11,"Left upper body discomfort?","Shows if the left upper area feels mild or severe discomfort (-10 = none, +10 = very bad, 0 = normal).","Move or press gently around the left upper side (shoulder, arm, etc.). If very painful, go positive. If no pain, go negative. Zero is normal."
r_upper_pain,11,"Right upper body discomfort?","Shows if the right upper area feels mild or severe discomfort (-10 = none, +10 = very bad, 0 = normal).","Move or press gently around the right upper side (shoulder, arm, etc.). If very painful, go positive. If no pain, go negative. Zero is normal."
