I am developing an app to ask questions to user to asses their posture.

The goal here is creating a Muscle Assesment matrix 

When user answers the question in questions list, those answers will be saved in Answers array.

When I multiply the AnswerArray and the Muscle Assesment Matrix, I should have 248 element ( element count of Muscle list ) array. Lets call this resulting array as MuscleStatus Array.

By using musclestatus array, I will know how the user's muscle status are, if any muscle is tight, or weak and overstreteched etc.

if a value in Muscle status array is negative, then that means that specific muscle is tight and shortened, and needs to be stretched. If a value in Muscle Status array is positive, then that means that specific muscle is over stretched and needs to be trained. 

Create the Muscle Assesment Matrix by using scientific resources as a reference. Use larger values if the relation between that question and that muscle is stronger. Muscle Assesment Matrix values should be between -10 and 10. Consider the chain effect on posture. Consider compensating behaviour of posture problems.

Consider the chain effect on posture. Consider compensating behavior of posture problems. Consider main focus area of the question can affect neighboring areas. Consider main focus of the question can disrupt areas on above or below, for example; weak muscle on foot can create compensating tightness on thoracic region.  

Use biomechanical bilateral equations, or clinic information or scientific data to fill the matrix. If you can't find solid information, use approximated or predicted values but try to make those approximations or predictions super accurate. This is not a hypothetical data. 

Verify your own data by checking the symmetry of values. For example, questions for left and right must have symmetric values over same right and left muscles

Do not print comments or summary. Only print the CSV file.

Every row represents another muscle and every column represents another question in this CSV file. Each Cell represents the relation bw corresponding muscle and question.


Create CSV table only for Neck(Cervical). Do not create example table, create real table with real and scientific resources.
